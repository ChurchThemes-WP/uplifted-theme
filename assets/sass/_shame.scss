// _shame.scss is a temporaily storage for bad code,
// hacks, and anything you need to quickly add to a
// site in a jiffy without messing up the core codebase.

// however, added code is not meant to live here permenantly,
// all code should be reviewed and placed in the appropriate
// place when the time is available
